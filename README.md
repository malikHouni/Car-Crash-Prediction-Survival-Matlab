# Car-Crash-Prediction-Survival-Matlab

The goal of this project is predicting the survival of passengers based on a set of data. Necessary data is retrieved from Kaggle .
Basic Usage

    .m files should be opened with MATLAB.
    Datasets should be in the same path with the code, if not path of the datasets must be set manually or fixed in the code.

    CarData = readtable('carcrash_train_new.csv');
# Prediction Result:

We achieve a score of 93.45% of accuracy.
